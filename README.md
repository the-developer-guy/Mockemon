# Mockemon
 Mocked trading app for Gen 1 Pok√©mon games

## Goal

I saw [a Flipper Zero based trader app](https://github.com/EstebanFuentealba/Flipper-Zero-Game-Boy-Pokemon-Trading) and while I don't believe in [silly gov regulations](https://hackaday.com/2024/02/12/canada-bans-flipper-zero-over-what-it-imagines-it-does/) would limit people getting a Flipper, having a bit more universal soulution would be nice.

It would be nice to have a super cheap, PC based solution, but the Game Boy uses SPI to communicate. (goodbye cheap USB-UART dongles) Searching for a solution.

Special thanks for all the community effort! (because why reverse-engineer from zero)
